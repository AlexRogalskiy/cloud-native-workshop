## Overview

This immersive demo will put you in the role of a Developer in the Cloud Native world. This two-part demo delivers an end-to-end Developer journey through the Inner Loop and the Outer Loop of Cloud Native Technologies.
- **Part One - Inner Loop** (before committing the code): Build, Run and Deploy a microservice based application to OpenShift. 
- **Part Two - Outer Loop** (after pushing the code to source control): First Containerize and then Promote the application to the staging environment using rich advanced development tools.
