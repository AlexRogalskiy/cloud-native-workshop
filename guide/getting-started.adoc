== Getting Started

_5 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about providing your Developer Workspace with a Kubernetes-native development platform 
and getting familiar with the OpenShift CLI and OpenShift Web Console.

=== What is Eclipse Che?

https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^] is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform.

As an open-source project, the core goals of https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]  are to:

* **Accelerate project and developer onboarding:** As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]  makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project.
* **Remove inconsistency between developer environments:** No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment.
* **Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness:** As https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]  becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines.

To achieve those core goals, https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]  provides:

* **Workspaces:** Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications.
* **Browser-based IDEs:** Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tooling, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more.
* **Extensible platform:** Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plug-ins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions.
* **Enterprise Integration:** Multi-user capabilities, including Keycloak for authentication and integration with LDAP or AD.

=== Getting your Developer Workspace with a single click

https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]  will provide you an out-of-box 
*Developer Workspace* with all the tools and the dependencies we need to do the job. **And with only one single click!**

[NOTE]
.Devfile
====
https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^] uses https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile/[Devfiles^] to automate the provisioning 
of a specific workspace by defining:

* projects to clone
* browser IDE to use
* preconfigured commands
* tools that you need
* application runtime definition

Providing a https://github.com/mcouliba/debugging-workshop/blob/master/devfile.yaml[devfile.yaml^] file inside a Git source repository signals to https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^] to configure the project and runtime according 
to this file.
====

`*Click on the below button called 'Developer Workspace'*`

[link={{ CHE_URL }}/dashboard/#/ide/{{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/wksp-cloud-native]
[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::{% image_path developer-workspace-button.png  %}[Developer Workspace - Button, 300]

Then `*login as {{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }}*`, `*click on 'Allow selected permissions'*` and let's the magic happens...

Once completed, you will have a fully functional Browser-based IDE within the source code already imported.

=== Connect Your Workspace to Your OpenShift User

First, you need to connect your {{ CHE_URL }}[Che Workspace^] to the OpenShift cluster.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Task: Run Task...' ->  'OpenShift - Login'*`

image:{% image_path che-openshift-login.png %}[Che - OpenShift Login, 500]

[NOTE]
.Command Info
====
The command **oc login --server={{ OPENSHIFT_API_URL }}:6443** is issued using the credentials `{{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }}`
====

You should get an output in the **'>_ oc login' Terminal Window** as following:

[source,shell]
.>_ oc login
----
Login successful.
 
You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':
 
  * {{ PROJECT }}
    {{ INFRA_PROJECT }}
    workspaceiwml5w542l456ja7

Using project "{{ PROJECT }}".
Already on project "{{ PROJECT }}" on server "https://172.30.0.1:443".

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to
perform various tasks via a browser.  To get a feel for how the web console
works, open your browser and `*go to {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^]*`.

`*Enter your username and password ({{OPENSHIFT_USER}}/{{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}})*` and 
then log in. After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
list of projects that your user has permission to work with. 

`*Select the 'Developer View' then your '{{PROJECT}}'*` to be taken to the project overview page
which will list all of the routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have
running as part of your project. There's nothing there now, but that's about to
change.
