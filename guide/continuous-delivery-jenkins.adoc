==  Automating Deployments Using Jenkins Pipelines

_20 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about deployment pipelines and you will create a pipeline to 
automate build and deployment of the Inventory service.

.Continuous Delivery
--
So far you have been building and deploying each service manually to OpenShift. Although 
it's convenient for local development, it's an error-prone way of delivering software if 
extended to test and production environments.

Continuous Delivery (CD) refers to a set of practices with the intention of automating 
various aspects of delivery software. One of these practices is called **Delivery Pipeline** 
which is an automated process to define the steps a change in code or configuration has 
to go through in order to reach upper environments and eventually to production. 

OpenShift simplifies building CI/CD Pipelines by integrating
the popular https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/[Jenkins Pipelines^] into
the platform and enables defining truly complex workflows directly from within OpenShift.

https://gogs.io[Gogs^] is a painless self-hosted Git service.

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. 
With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across ALL platforms that Go supports, including Linux, 
Mac OS X, Windows and ARM.

=== Create a Git Repository for Inventory

The first step for any deployment pipeline is to store all code and configurations in 
a source code repository. You can use any Git server (e.g. GitHub, BitBucket, etc) for this lab but we have prepared a 
Gogs git server.

In {{ GOGS_URL }}[Gogs^], `*Click on 'Register'*` to register a new user with the following details:


.Gogs Registration
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value

|Username 
|{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}

|Email
|your email  (Don't worry! Gogs won't send you any emails)

|Password
|{{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}}

| Re-Type
|{{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}}

|===

=== Push Inventory Code to the Git Repository

Now that you have a Git repository for the Inventory service, you should push the 
source code into this Git repository.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Git: Initialize Repository'*`

image:{% image_path che-git-init.png %}[Che - Git Initialize, 600]

`*Select the '/projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus' folder, click on 'Initialize Repository' -> 'Add to Workspace'*`

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], open a new Terminal by `*clicking 
on the 'My Workspace' white box in the right menu, then 'Plugins' -> 'workshop-tools' -> '>_ New terminal'*`:

image:{% image_path che-open-workshop-terminal.png %}[Che - Open OpenShift Terminal, 700]

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ cd /projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus
$ git remote add origin <PASTE-YOUR-GIT_REPO-URL-HERE>
----

Via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Git: Close Repository'*`

Via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Git: Open Repository' and select the '/projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus' folder*`

Open the **Source Code Management (SCM) view** via the shortcut `*Cmd+Shift+G ⌘⇧G on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+G ⌃⇧G on Windows and Linux.*`

`*Click on '...' -> 'Stage All Changes'*`

image:{% image_path che-scm-stage-all-changes.png %}[Che - SCM Stage All Changes, 500]

`*Click on the 'check' icon and enter 'Initial' as commit message*`

image:{% image_path che-scm-commit.png %}[Che - SCM Commit, 900]

`*Click on '...' -> 'Push'*`

image:{% image_path che-scm-push.png %}[Che - SCM Push, 500]

`*Click on the 'OK' button*` to publish the new **master branch**. 
Finally, `*enter your Gogs credentials ({{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }})*`.

image:{% image_path che-scm-username.png %}[Che - SCM Username, 500]

image:{% image_path che-scm-password.png %}[Che - SCM Password, 500]

Once done, `*refresh the page of your 'inventory-quarkus' repository*`. You should 
see the project files in the repository.

=== What is Jenkins?

[sidebar]
--
image:{% image_path jenkins-logo.png %}[Gogs, 200]

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, 
testing, and delivering or deploying software.

Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a 
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

'''

=== Define the Deployment Pipeline

OpenShift has built-in support for CI/CD pipelines by allowing developers to define 
a https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/[Jenkins Pipeline^] for execution by a Jenkins 
automation engine, which is automatically provisioned on-demand by OpenShift when needed.

The build can get started, monitored, and managed by OpenShift in 
the same way as any other build types e.g. S2I. Pipeline workflows are defined in 
a Jenkinsfile, either embedded directly in the build configuration, or supplied in 
a Git repository and referenced by the build configuration. 

Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline 
and is created using a https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[scripted or declarative syntax^].

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], `*create a new file called 'Jenkinsfile' under the '/projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus' folder*`
with the following content:

[source,groovy]
.Jenkinsfile
----
pipeline {
  agent {
      label 'maven'
  }
  stages {
    stage('Build JAR') { #<1>
      steps {
        sh "mvn clean package -DskipTests"
        stash name:"jar", includes:"target/inventory-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar"
      }
    }
    stage('Build Image') { #<2>
      steps {
        unstash name:"jar"
        script {
          openshift.withCluster() {
            openshift.startBuild("inventory", "--from-file=target/inventory-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar", "--wait")
          }
        }
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy') { #<3>
      steps {
        script {
          openshift.withCluster() {
            def dc = openshift.selector("dc", "inventory")
            dc.rollout().latest()
            dc.rollout().status()
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> **Build JAR**: to build and test the jar file using Maven
<2> **Build Image**: to build a container image from the Inventory JAR archive using OpenShift S2I
<3> **Deploy**: to deploy the Inventory container image in the current project

TIP: The pipeline definition is fully integrated with OpenShift and you can 
perform operations like image build, image deploy, etc directly from within the *_Jenkinsfile_*.

TIP: When building deployment pipelines, it's important to treat your https://martinfowler.com/bliki/InfrastructureAsCode.html[infrastructure and everything else that needs to be configured (including the pipeline definition) as code^] 
and store them in a source repository for version control. 

Open the **Source Code Management (SCM) view** via the shortcut `*Cmd+Shift+G ⌘⇧G on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+G ⌃⇧G on Windows and Linux.*`

`*Stage, commit with the message 'Pipeline added', and push*` into your Git repo

The pipeline definition is ready and now you can create a deployment pipeline using 
this **Jenkinsfile**.

'''

=== Create an OpenShift Jenkins Pipeline

Like mentioned, {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#pipeline-build[OpenShift Pipelines^] enable creating deployment pipelines using the widely popular *_Jenkinsfile_* format.

OpenShift automates deployments using {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.html#triggers[deployment triggers^] 
that react to changes to the container image or configuration. Since you want to control the deployments instead from the pipeline, 
you should remove the Inventory deploy triggers so that building a new Inventory container image wouldn't automatically result in a 
new deployment. That would allow the pipeline to decide when a deployment should occur.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], open a new Terminal by `*clicking 
on the 'My Workspace' white box in the right menu, then 'Plugins' -> 'workshop-tools' -> '>_ New terminal'*`:

image:{% image_path che-open-workshop-terminal.png %}[Che - Open OpenShift Terminal, 700]

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ oc set triggers dc/inventory --manual #<1>
$ oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral --param=MEMORY_LIMIT="2Gi" #<2>
$ oc patch dc/jenkins -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"jenkins","resources":{"limits":{"cpu":"2"}}}]}}}}' #<3>
----
<1> Disable automatic rollout trigger
<2> Deploy a Jenkins server using the provided template and container image that 
comes out-of-the-box with OpenShift
<3> Change the CPU Limit of Jenkins Pod to 2Gi

In the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on the 'Open URL' icon of the Jenkins Server*`

image:{% image_path openshift-jenkins-topology.png %}[OpenShift - Inventory Topology, 700]

Your browser will be redirect on your **Jenkins Server** running on OpenShift. 
`*Log in as {{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }}*`.
After Jenkins is deployed and is running, create a deployment pipeline by running the following command:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ cd /projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus
$ oc new-app . --name=inventory-pipeline --strategy=pipeline #<1>
----
<1> It creates a new build config of type pipeline 
which is automatically configured to fetch the **Jenkinsfile** from the Git repository 
and execute it on Jenkins

In the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Builds' -> 'BC inventory-pipeline' -> 'Builds' -> 'B inventory-pipeline'*`

image:{% image_path cd-pipeline-inprogress.png %}[OpenShift Pipeline,900]

TIP: Pipeline syntax allows creating complex deployment scenarios with the possibility of defining 
checkpoint for manual interaction and approval process using 
https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/[the large set of steps and plugins that Jenkins provide^] in 
order to adapt the pipeline to the process used in your team. You can see a few examples of 
advanced pipelines in the 
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline[OpenShift GitHub Repository^].

TIP: In order to update the deployment pipeline, all you need to do is to update the *_Jenkinsfile_* 
in the **inventory-quarkus** Git repository. OpenShift pipeline automatically executes the 
updated pipeline next time it runs.

'''

=== Run the Pipeline on Every Code Change

Manually triggering the deployment pipeline to run is useful but the real goal is to be able 
to build and deploy every change in code or configuration at least to lower environments 
(e.g. dev and test) and ideally all the way to production with some manual approvals in-place.

In order to automate triggering the pipeline, you can define a *_Webhook_* on your Git repository 
to notify OpenShift on every commit that is made to the Git repository and trigger a pipeline 
execution.

In the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], 
`*click on 'Builds -> 'BC inventory-pipeline' and copy the 'Generic Webhook' URL*` which you will need in the next steps.

image:{% image_path openshift-pipeline-webhook.png %}[OpenShift - Pipeline Webhook, 700]

In {{ GOGS_URL }}[Gogs^], `*go to your 'inventory-quarkus' repository and click on 'Settings'*`

image:{% image_path cd-gogs-settings.png %}[Repository Settings,900]

Then, `*click on 'Webhooks' -> 'Add Webhook' -> 'Gogs'*`. Create a webhook with the following details:

* **Payload URL**: paste the Generic webhook url you copied from the *_inventory-pipeline_*
* **Content type**: *_application/json_*

.Webhook Settings
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value

|Payload URL
|Paste the Generic Webhook URL you copied from the **inventory-pipeline**

|===

image:{% image_path cd-gogs-webhook-add.png %}[Repository Webhook,660]

`*Click on 'Add Webhook'*`

All done. You can click on the newly defined webhook to see the list of *Recent Delivery*. 

`*Click on the 'Test Delivery' button*` and verify that the **inventory-pipeline** starts running 
immediately. This button allows you to manually trigger the webhook for testing purposes.

Well done! You are ready for the next lab.
