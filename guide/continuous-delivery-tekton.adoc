==  Automating Deployments Using OpenShift Pipelines

_20 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about deployment pipelines and you will create a pipeline to 
automate build and deployment of the Inventory service.

.Continuous Delivery
--
So far you have been building and deploying each service manually to OpenShift. Although 
it's convenient for local development, it's an error-prone way of delivering software if 
extended to test and production environments.

Continuous Delivery (CD) refers to a set of practices with the intention of automating 
various aspects of delivery software. One of these practices is called **Delivery Pipeline** 
which is an automated process to define the steps a change in code or configuration has 
to go through in order to reach upper environments and eventually to production. 

OpenShift simplifies building CI/CD Pipelines by integrating
the popular https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/[Jenkins Pipelines^] into
the platform and enables defining truly complex workflows directly from within OpenShift.

https://gogs.io[Gogs^] is a painless self-hosted Git service.

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. 
With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across ALL platforms that Go supports, including Linux, 
Mac OS X, Windows and ARM.

=== Create a Git Repository for Inventory

The first step for any deployment pipeline is to store all code and configurations in 
a source code repository. You can use any Git server (e.g. GitHub, BitBucket, etc) for this lab but we have prepared a 
Gogs git server.

In {{ GOGS_URL }}[Gogs^], `*Click on 'Register'*` to register a new user with the following details:


.Gogs Registration
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value

|Username 
|{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}

|Email
|your email  (Don't worry! Gogs won't send you any emails)

|Password
|{{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}}

| Re-Type
|{{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}}

=== Push Inventory Code to the Git Repository

Now that you have a Git repository for the Inventory service, you should push the 
source code into this Git repository.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Git: Initialize Repository'*`

image:{% image_path che-git-init.png %}[Che - Git Initialize, 600]

`*Select the '/projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus' folder, click on 'Initialize Repository' -> 'Add to Workspace'*`

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], open a new Terminal by `*clicking 
on the 'My Workspace' white box in the right menu, then 'Plugins' -> 'workshop-tools' -> '>_ New terminal'*`:

image:{% image_path che-open-workshop-terminal.png %}[Che - Open OpenShift Terminal, 700]

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ cd /projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus
$ git remote add origin {{ GOGS_URL }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/inventory-quarkus
----

Via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Git: Close Repository'*`

Via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Git: Open Repository' and select the '/projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus' folder*`

Open the **Source Code Management (SCM) view** via the shortcut `*Cmd+Shift+G ⌘⇧G on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+G ⌃⇧G on Windows and Linux.*`

`*Click on '...' -> 'Stage All Changes'*`

image:{% image_path che-scm-stage-all-changes.png %}[Che - SCM Stage All Changes, 500]

`*Click on the 'check' icon and enter 'Initial' as commit message*`

image:{% image_path che-scm-commit.png %}[Che - SCM Commit, 900]

`*Click on '...' -> 'Push'*`

image:{% image_path che-scm-push.png %}[Che - SCM Push, 500]

`*Click on the 'OK' button*` to publish the new **master branch**. 
Finally, `*enter your Gogs credentials ({{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }})*`.

image:{% image_path che-scm-username.png %}[Che - SCM Username, 500]

image:{% image_path che-scm-password.png %}[Che - SCM Password, 500]

Once done, `*refresh the page of your 'inventory-quarkus' repository*`. You should 
see the project files in the repository.

=== What is OpenShift Pipelines?

[sidebar]

image:{% image_path tekton-logo.png %}[Tekton, 300]

OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution 
for building pipelines based on  https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline[Tekton Pipelines^] project.

* Standard CI/CD pipeline definition based on Tekton
* Build images with Kubernetes tools such as S2I, Buildah, Buildpacks, Kaniko, etc
* Deploy applications to multiple platforms such as Kubernetes, serverless and VMs
* Easy to extend and integrate with existing tools
* Scale pipelines on-demand
* Portable across any Kubernetes platform
* Designed for microservices and decentralized teams
* Integrated with the OpenShift Developer Console

https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline[Tekton Pipelines^] provides Kubernetes-style resources for creating serverless 
CI/CD-style pipelines on Kubernetes.

The custom resources needed to define a pipeline are:

* **Task** - a reusable, loosely coupled number of steps that perform a specific task (e.g., building a container image)
* **Pipeline** - the definition of the pipeline and the **Task** that it should perform
* **PipelineResource** - inputs (e.g., git repository) and outputs (e.g., image registry) to and out of a **Pipeline** or **Task**
* **TaskRun** - the result of running an instance of **Task**
* **PipelineRun** - the result of running an instance of **Pipeline**, which includes a number of **TaskRun**

=== Disable Automatic Deployment Trigger

OpenShift automates deployments using {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.html#triggers[deployment triggers^] 
that react to changes to the container image or configuration. 
Since you want to control the deployments instead from the pipeline, 
you should remove the Inventory deploy triggers so that building a new Inventory container 
image wouldn't automatically result in a new deployment. That would allow the pipeline to decide when a 
deployment should occur.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], open a new Terminal by `*clicking 
on the 'My Workspace' white box in the right menu, then 'Plugins' -> 'workshop-tools' -> '>_ New terminal'*`:

image:{% image_path che-open-workshop-terminal.png %}[Che - Open OpenShift Terminal, 700]

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ oc set triggers dc/inventory --remove-all
----

'''

=== Create a Task

A **Task** consists of a collection of steps that are executed sequentially. 
Each **Task** is executed in a separate container within the same pod. 
They can also have inputs and outputs in order to interact with other tasks in the pipeline.


In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: maven-build
spec:
  inputs:
    resources:
    - name: source-repo
      type: git
  outputs:
    resources:
    - name: source-repo
      type: git    
  steps:
  - name: build
    image: 'maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim'
    workingdir: /workspace/source-repo
    command:
    - /usr/bin/mvn
    args:
    - clean 
    - package 
    - '-DskipTests' 
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /.m2
      name: m2-folder
  - name: copy-jar
    image: 'registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:latest'
    command:
    - /usr/bin/bash
    args: 
    - '-c'
    - 'cp /workspace/source-repo/target/*.jar /workspace/output/source-repo/ROOT.jar'
  volumes:
  - name: m2-folder
    emptyDir: {}
EOF
----

'''

=== Create a Pipeline

A **Pipeline** defines a number of **Task** that should be executed and how they interact 
with each other via their inputs and outputs.

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: my-pipeline
spec:
  resources:
  - name: app-git
    type: git
  tasks:
  - name: build-jar
    taskRef:
      name: maven-build
    resources:
      inputs:
      - name: source-repo
        resource: app-git
      outputs:
      - name: source-repo
        resource: app-git
EOF
----

'''

=== Create a Pipeline Resource

A **PipelineResource** in a pipeline are the set of objects that are going to be used as inputs to a **Task** 
and can be output by a **Task**.

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell]
.>_ workshop-tools terminal
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: inventory-git
spec:
  type: git
  params:
  - name: url
    value: {{ GOGS_URL }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/inventory-quarkus.git
  - name: revision
    value: master
EOF
----

'''

=== Run the Pipeline

Now that your pipeline is created and configured, let's trigger it.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Task: Run Task...' ->  'che: Pipeline - Start Mine'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-pipeline-start-mine.png %}[Che - Pipeline Start Mine, 500]

Once done, in the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Pipelines' -> 'Last Run - my-pipeline-run'*`

image:{% image_path openshift-pipeline-mine.png %}[OpenShift Pipeline,400]

Congratulations!! You have created and run your first **OpenShift Pipeline with Tekton**!!

'''

=== Expand your Pipeline

Now, you have learnt and understood how to create a simple **Pipeline** with **Task** and **PipelineResource**.
Let's create more tasks and expand the existing pipeline.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], `*double click on the following files*` then 
via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Kubernetes: Create'*`

image:{% image_path che-kubernetes-create.png %}[Che - Kubernetes Create, 500]
