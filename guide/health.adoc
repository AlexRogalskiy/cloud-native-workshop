== Monitoring Application Health 

_15 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab we will learn how to monitor application health using OpenShift 
health probes and how you can see container resource consumption using metrics.

=== What is OpenShift Health Probes?

[sidebar]
--

When building microservices, monitoring becomes of extreme importance to make sure all services 
are running at all times, and when they don't there are automatic actions triggered to rectify 
the issues. 

OpenShift, using Kubernetes health probes, offers a solution for monitoring application 
health and trying to automatically heal faulty containers through restarting them to fix issues such as
a deadlock in the application which can be resolved by restarting the container. Restarting a container 
in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.

Furthermore, there are of course a category of issues that can't be resolved by restarting the container. 
In those scenarios, OpenShift would remove the faulty container from the built-in load-balancer and send traffic 
only to the healthy containers that remain.

There are two types of health probes available in OpenShift: {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/dev_guide/application_health.html#container-health-checks-using-probes[liveness probes and readiness probes^]. 

* **Liveness probes** are to know when to restart a container
* **Readiness probes** to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.

Health probes also provide crucial benefits when automating deployments with practices like rolling updates in 
order to remove downtime during deployments. A readiness health probe would signal OpenShift when to switch 
traffic from the old version of the container to the new version so that the users don't get affected during 
deployments.

There are {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/dev_guide/application_health.html#container-health-checks-using-probes[three ways to define a health probe^] for a container:

* **HTTP Checks:** healthiness of the container is determined based on the response code of an HTTP 
endpoint. Anything between 200 and 399 is considered success. A HTTP check is ideal for applications 
that return HTTP status codes when completely initialized.

* **Container Execution Checks:** a specified command is executed inside the container and the healthiness is 
determined based on the return value (0 is success). 

* **TCP Socket Checks:** a socket is opened on a specified port to the container and it's considered healthy 
only if the check can establish a connection. TCP socket check is ideal for applications that do not 
start listening until initialization is complete.

===  Explore Health REST Endpoints

Let's add health probes to the microservices deployed so far.
Spring Boot, Thorntail and Vert.x all provide out-of-the-box support for creating RESTful endpoints that
provide details on the health of the application. These endpoints by default provide basic data about the 
service however they all provide a way to customize the health data and add more meaningful information (e.g. 
database connection health, backoffice system availability, etc).

http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready[Spring Boot Actuator^] is a 
sub-project of Spring Boot which adds health and management HTTP endpoints to the application. Enabling Spring Boot 
Actuator is done via adding **org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator** dependency to the Maven project 
dependencies which is already done for the **Catalog Service**.

Verify that the health endpoint works for the **Catalog Service** using `*curl*`

----
$ curl -w "\n" http://catalog.{{PROJECT}}.svc:8080/actuator/health

{"status":"UP"}
----

https://docs.thorntail.io/2.2.0.Final/#_microprofile_health[Thorntail health endpoints^] function in a similar fashion and are enabled by adding **io.thorntail:microprofile-health** 
to the Maven project dependencies. 
This is also already done for the **Inventory Service**.

Verify that the health endpoint works for the **Inventory Service** using `*curl*`

----
$ curl http://inventory.{{PROJECT}}.svc:8080/node

{
    "name" : "localhost",
    "server-state" : "running",
    "suspend-state" : "RUNNING",
    "running-mode" : "NORMAL",
    "uuid" : "79b3ffc5-d98c-4b8e-ae5c-9756ed13944a",
    "swarm-version" : "2.2.0.Final-redhat-00021"
}
----

Expectedly, Eclipse Vert.x also provides a http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-health-check/java[health check module^] 
which is enabled by adding **io.vertx:vertx-health-check** as a dependency to the Maven project. 

Verify that the health endpoint works for the **Gateway Service** using `*curl*`

----
$ curl http://gateway.{{PROJECT}}.svc:8080/health

{"status":"UP"}
----

Last but not least, although you can build more sophisticated health endpoints for the Web UI as well, you 
can use the root context ("/") of the Web UI in this lab to verify it's up and running.

Health probes are defined on the deployment config for each pod and can be added using OpenShift Web 
Console or OpenShift CLI. You will try both in this lab.

===  Monitoring Catalog Service Health

http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready[Spring Boot Actuator^] is a 
sub-project of Spring Boot which adds health and management HTTP endpoints to the application. Enabling Spring Boot 
Actuator is done via adding **org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator** dependency to the Maven project 
dependencies which is already done for the **Catalog Service**.

Verify that the health endpoint works for the **Catalog Service** using `*curl*`

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -w "\n" http://catalog.{{PROJECT}}.svc:8080/actuator/health

{"status":"UP"}
----

Like mentioned, health probes are defined on a deployment config for each pod. Review the available 
deployment configs in the project. 

[source,shell]
----
$ oc set probe dc/catalog \
    --liveness \# <1>
    --readiness \# <2>
    --initial-delay-seconds=30 \# <3>
    --failure-threshold=3 \# <4>
    --get-url=http://:8080/actuator/health # <5>
----
<1> **--liveness** is the option to setup a liveness probe to verify this container is running
<2> **--liveness** is the option to setup a readiness probe to indicate when this container should receive traffic
<3> **--initial-delay-seconds** is the option to specify how long 
to wait after the container starts and before to begin checking the probes
<4> **--failure-threshold** is the number of failures before the probe is considered to have failed
<5> **--get-url** defines the HTTP endpoint to use for check the liveness of the container. The ***http://:8080*** 
syntax is a convenient way to define the endpoint without having to worry about the hostname for the running 
container. 

[NOTE]
.Deployment Triggers
====
OpenShift automates deployments using 
{{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.html#triggers[deployment triggers^] 
that react to changes to the container image or configuration. 
Therefore, as soon as you define the probe, OpenShift automatically redeploys the pod using the new configuration including the liveness probe. 
====

[TIP]
====
It's recommended to have separate endpoints for readiness and liveness to indicate to OpenShift when 
to restart the container and when to leave it alone and remove it from the load-balancer so that an administrator 
would  manually investigate the issue. 
====

Voilà! OpenShift automatically restarts the Catalog pod and as soon as the 
health probes succeed, it is ready to receive traffic.

===  Monitoring Inventory Service Health

https://quarkus.io/guides/health-guide[SmallRye Health^] is a Quarkus extension which utilizes the MicroProfile Health specification.
It allows applications to provide information about their state to external viewers which is typically useful 
in cloud environments where automated processes must be able to determine whether the application should be discarded or restarted.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Quarkus: Add extensions to current project'*`

Via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Task: Run Task...' ->  'che: Inventory - Build on OpenShift'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-inventory-build-openshift.png %}[Che - Inventory Build On OpenShift, 500]

Verify that the health endpoint works for the **Inventory Service** using `*curl*`

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -w "\n" http://inventory.{{PROJECT}}.svc:8080/health

{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "Database connection(s) health check",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}
----

Finally, `*Add the Liveness and Readiness Probes*` to the Service

----
$ oc rollout pause dc/inventory
$ oc set probe dc/inventory --readiness --initial-delay-seconds=30 --failure-threshold=3 --get-url=http://:8080/health/ready
$ oc set probe dc/inventory --liveness --initial-delay-seconds=30 --failure-threshold=3 --get-url=http://:8080/health/live
$ oc rollout resume dc/inventory
----

OpenShift automatically restarts the Inventory pod and as soon as the health probes succeed, it is ready to receive traffic.

===  Monitoring API Gateway Health

Expectedly, Eclipse Vert.x also provides a http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-health-check/java[health check module^] 
which is enabled by adding **io.vertx:vertx-health-check** as a dependency to the Maven project. 

Verify that the health endpoint works for the **Gateway Service** using `*curl*`

----
$ curl -w "\n" http://gateway.{{PROJECT}}.svc:8080/health

===  Monitoring Web UI Health TODO

Although you can add the liveness and health probes to the Web UI using a single CLI command, let's 
give the OpenShift Web Console a try this time.

`*Go to {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^]*` in your browser and in the **{{PROJECT}}** project. 
`*Click on 'Applications > Deployments'*` on the left-side bar. `*Click on 'web > Configuration tab'*`.
You will see the warning about health checks, with a link to
click in order to add them. `*Click on 'Add health checks'*` now. 

TIP: Instead of **Configuration** tab, you can directly click on **Actions** button on the top-right 
and then **Edit Health Checks**

image:{% image_path health-web-details.png %}[Health Probes,900]

You will want to `*click on both 'Add Readiness Probe' and 'Add Liveness Probe'*` and
then fill them out as follows:

Readiness Probe::
* Path: **/**
* Initial Delay: **10**
* Timeout: **1**

Liveness Probe::
* Path: **/**
* Initial Delay: **180**
* Timeout: **1**

image:{% image_path health-readiness.png %}[Readiness Probe,700]

image:{% image_path health-liveness.png %}[Readiness Probe,700]

`*Click on 'Save'*` and then `*click the 'Overview' button*` in the left navigation. You
will notice that Web UI pod is getting restarted and it stays light blue
for a while. This is a sign that the pod(s) have not yet passed their readiness
checks and it turns blue when it's ready!

image:{% image_path health-web-redeploy.png %}[Web Redeploy,740]

'''

=== Monitoring Metrics TODO

Metrics are another important aspect of monitoring applications which is required in order to 
gain visibility into how the application behaves and particularly in identifying issues.

OpenShift provides container metrics out-of-the-box and displays how much memory, cpu and network 
each container has been consuming over time. In the project overview, you can see three charts 
near each pod that shows the resource consumption by that pod.

image:{% image_path health-metrics-brief.png %}[Container Metrics,740]

`*Click on any of the pods*` (blue circle) which takes you to the pod details. `*Click on the 'Metrics' tab*`
to see a more detailed view of the metrics charts.

image:{% image_path health-metrics-detailed.png %}[Container Metrics,900]

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
